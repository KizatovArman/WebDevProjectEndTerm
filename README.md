Press F to stay Fit. In today’s fast-paced world people get carried away with everyday routine and forget about things that really matter. And that thing was Albert.. Sorry. People forget about their health, they sit in front of the computer most of their time, have little to none of physical activities, they eat unhealthy food because it’s fast, easy and accessible. And that’s where our company joins the game. Our product is going to help people start working out, calculate the amount of calories for a daily food intake, it will also provide a guidance into each workout routine, and show the complete information about each exercise. For the advanced users we are going to provide a sport supplement information, and also a website where certain supplements can be bought.
